// Issue #6: Type System - Overly Broad Signed/Unsigned Compatibility
// All signed integers are considered compatible with each other.
// This means i8 is compatible with i64, allowing dangerous assignments.
// An i64 value assigned to an i8 will silently overflow.
// The type system should be stricter or at least warn on range-reducing assignments.

i32 main() {
    i64 large = 1000000000000;
    i8 small = large;  // Silent overflow - should warn or error
    return small;
}
