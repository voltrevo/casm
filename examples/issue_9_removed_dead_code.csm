// Issue #9: Broken and Unused lexer_peek_token()
// The function was broken and never called anywhere in the codebase.
// It had a comment acknowledging it doesn't work properly.
// The parser uses a local check() helper function instead.
// This function has been removed as part of dead code cleanup.
// No example program can trigger this - it's dead code that was removed.
