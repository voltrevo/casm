// Issue #5: No Uninitialized Variable Detection
// Variables can be declared without initialization and used immediately.
// The semantic analyzer never tracks which variables have been initialized.
// This allows undefined behavior (reading garbage memory).
// The compiler should error on use of uninitialized variables.
