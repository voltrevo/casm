// Issue #8: Missing Statement Type for Bare Blocks
// The statement type enumeration doesn't have STMT_BLOCK.
// Bare blocks { } cannot be parsed.
// This is the same issue as #3 - attempting to parse bare blocks
// causes an infinite loop because there's no way to represent them.
// See issue_3_infinite_loop_bare_blocks.csm
