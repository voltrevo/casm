// Issue #7: Inconsistent Memory Deallocation (src/parser.c:854)
// One place in parser.c uses bare free(stmt) instead of xfree(stmt).
// This is a maintainability issue - if error handling is added to xfree(),
// this one spot will be missed.
// This cannot be triggered by a program - it's purely a code quality issue.
// To verify: grep for "free(stmt)" in src/parser.c
