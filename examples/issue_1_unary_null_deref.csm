// Issue #1: NULL Pointer Dereference in Unary Expression Parsing
// parse_unary() recursively calls itself without NULL checking.
// However, the error recovery catches most cases before a crash.
// The potential crash would occur if semantic analysis tries to traverse
// a unary expression with a NULL operand (if somehow one is created).
// Hard to trigger - error handling is good here.
