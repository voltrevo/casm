- agents.md is always an ultra-concise list, do not change format
- when you finish a task, discuss with user before proceeding
- use tdd
- commit changes as you go
- do not tolerate memory leaks (your code should never leak, fix it immediately)
- all code is young and experimental, no backwards compatibility needed
- keep notes dir concise and up to date (describes the current state only, not things that were done)
