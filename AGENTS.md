- consult README.md and notes/ before work
- agents.md is always an ultra-concise list, do not change format
- if something is unfinished/unsolved, write code to exception/badexit/crash, do NOT ignore
- when you finish a task, discuss with user before proceeding
- use tdd
- prioritize testing with dbg_cases and do not add other tests unless needed
- commit changes as you go
- do not tolerate memory leaks (your code should never leak, fix it immediately)
- all code is young and experimental, no backwards compatibility needed
- keep notes dir concise and up to date (describes the current state only, not things that were done)
